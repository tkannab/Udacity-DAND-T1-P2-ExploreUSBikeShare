# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Term 1 - Project 2: Explore US Bike Share Data

## Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. You will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. You will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.

Check the Rubric
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/c028f7f5-1180-48dd-8921-736555242747/rubric). Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. Your project "meets specifications" only if it meets specifications in all the criteria. If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, be sure to take some time to revise your work until you feel it is up to expectations. In particular, there is one section of the rubric that cares about the quality of your code. It is not important just that you are able to obtain the correct answers, but it is also important that you have followed good coding practices to obtain your solutions.
